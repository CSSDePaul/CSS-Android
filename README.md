Attention CSS Android Crew!

At the moment I believe that my account is the only one capable of pushing changes directly to this repo! In order to work on this project, look in the upper right corner of the repo's main webpage (you're probably on it now) and press "Fork".

This will copy the repo in its current form to your own account. From there you can clone it to your machine and play with it as you desire. If you make a change that you think should be implemented into the main codebase you'll have to make a pull request. The name is a little misleading; it means that you are requesting that I pull code from your repository and put it in this main one.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to email me at matt (at) wylder (dot) us. PLEASE do not use the ISSUES tab for anything other than actual issues with the code!
